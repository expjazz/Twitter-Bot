# Microverse Ruby Capstone Project

> Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications. In this case, the goal was to build a personalized paged based on [this](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) layout.

### Prerequisites

Having a web browser, code editor and git.

### Instalation

### Setup

In order to test the Twitterbot you will need to apply for a [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en). Once you've gotten the confirmation email, create an app and give the permission to access your profile [instructions here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). Don't forget to save it's API token somewhere (dont share with other people, it is supposed to be unique). You will need the token in order to test the bot.

#### Install

First, fork the repo in your local machine and then create a new rb file to put your own API keys. Then, create constants (variables with capital letters) with the names equal in the twitter_control file. Then on the terminal, type in 'ruby bin/main.rb' and see the magic happens.

## What can it do

You can post, use content from the web in to your posts (via webscrapping - nokogiri and selenium). You can also track a hashtag and get information from the users that tweet in that hashtag (for marketing purposes)
