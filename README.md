## About the project

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of the each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. It is a real-world-like project built with business specifications This project was at the end of the Ruby curriculum section. I was asked to create a twitter bot with Ruby. I chose to create a bot to make the life of a business owner easier by running his twitter account during the day. My bot makes different tweets during the day, such as informing about the Covid-19 status, offering new promotions, giving informational articles, tracking new followers, sending welcoming messages for them and many features more. 

## Video Description

### Instalation

### Getting a green light from Twitter

In order to test the Twitterbot you will need to apply for a [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en). Once you've gotten the confirmation email, create an app and give the permission to access your profile [instructions here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). Don't forget to save it's API token somewhere (dont share with other people, it is supposed to be unique). You will need the token in order to test the bot.

### Setup

In order to test the bot, you do need to have Ruby (at least 2.5) and Rspec installed.

#### Installation

### Install

To test the bot locally, clone the repository, navigate to it's containing directory, and run:

#### Clone the repository and follow the steps to run the bot.

- $ `git clone https://github.com/expjazz/ruby-capstone.git`
- $  bundle install    -> run this command to install the required gems
- $  bin/main.rb       -> run this command to run the program
- $  gem install rspec -> run this command to install rspec 
- $  rspec             ->run this command to test the program with rspec

### Details 

First, fork the repo in your local machine and then run the user_keys.rb. Then, paste on the terminal your respective keys. Then, while still on the terminal, type in 'bin/main.rb' and see the magic happens.
